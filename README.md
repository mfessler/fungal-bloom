# fungal-bloom

In 2018, I took part in [Cragne Manor](https://rcveeder.net/cragne/): a massively collaborative work of interactive fiction (aka text adventure) created by 84 contributors on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of [Anchorhead](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=op0uw1gn1tjqmjt7), a work of Lovecraftian horror by Michael Gentry. The project was meant to be a pastiche and tribute of Anchorhead, but it became something far stranger.

I was one of those 84 contributors, receiving just a room title and a couple of details that needed to be included. The project was organized [Exquisite Corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse)-style, each contributor knowing almost nothing about other's work or how the pieces would be intergrated. If you'd like to read more about the process of organizing and assembling the project, see [This interview with project's organizers, Ryan Veeder and Jenni Polodna](https://portagemagazine.org/cragne-manor/).

The process was rewarding and a surprising amount of fun - I dabbled in the IF community in the mid-1990s, but hadn't written any code, and indeed precious little fiction, in 15 years. Many thanks to Ryan and Jenni for pulling this insane project together, and to my fellow contributors for their creativity and hard work. 

The full game was released on December 8th, 2018. Some reviews on release:

## Why am I releasing this?

The project was written in [Inform 7](http://inform7.com), a domain-specific language for interactive fiction. I'm publishing the source code for my specific room, in the form that I submitted it to the organizers. I'm doing this for a few reasons:

1) To let people see the work -- my room wound up being fairly far along in the game, so many people may not have had a chance to see it. It's hard to say to friends, "Hey, check out this project I was part of. But it'll take you a few hours of puzzle solving to get to my bit." 
1) To demonstrate some of the ways that a relative newcomer to Inform 7 can use the features of the language to tell a short interactive story
1) To document some of the creative process, dead ends, and reworked ideas that were part of the writing and testing process. Also, regrettable code, and jokes I had to omit.

## Technical details

This repo will contain Inform source code for my room, as well as a compiled game file that can be run on [Lectrote](https://github.com/erkyrath/lectrote). 

I'm also inclding a copy of the Inform extension "Cragne Suite.i7x" that was required for the project, in case anyone would like to play with the code themselves.

## Why "Fungal Bloom"?

All will become clear.
